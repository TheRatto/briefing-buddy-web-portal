# README Guide

## Purpose

This document provides guidance for writing `README.md`.

A README is the front door for humans. It should help a new reader understand:

- What the project is
- Who it is for
- How to run it (at a high level)
- Where to find the current state and scope

This is guidance, not a schema.

---

## Recommended README Content (Flexible)

Most READMEs should include:

- Project name and one-line summary
- What problem it solves
- Who it is for
- How to run or develop locally (high level)
- How to test (high level)
- Where to find:
  - Project intent: PROJECT_BRIEF.md
  - Current state: STATUS.md
  - Scope and backlog: FEATURES.md
  - Product context: PRD.md
  - Process and roles: framework/ (or equivalent)

Section names and order are flexible.

---

## What to Avoid

- Duplicating the full PRD or feature list
- Long narratives that will become stale
- Deep technical architecture (belongs in ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Detailed step-by-step contributor onboarding unless needed

---

## Tone and Style

- Keep it friendly and direct
- Assume the reader is new to the repo
- Prefer short sections and bullet points
- Follow STYLE_GUIDE.md conventions where practical

---

## Update Rules

- Update README when the way to run/test the project changes
- Update README when major user-facing goals change
- Do not update README for routine feature work unless it changes usage
