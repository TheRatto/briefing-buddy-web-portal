# PROJECT_BRIEF Schema

## Purpose

This document defines the **required structure** for `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.

`PROJECT_BRIEF.md` provides a single-page orientation for all agents and humans.
It must be concise, stable, and readable in under two minutes.

This is a **light schema**. Content matters more than wording.

---

## Required Sections

---

## Project Summary

- One or two sentences describing what this project is
- Written for a new reader

---

## Problem Statement

- What problem is being solved
- Why it matters
- Who experiences the problem

---

## Target Users

- Primary user types
- Secondary users (if any)

---

## Goals

- What success looks like
- Outcomes, not features

---

## Non-Goals

- What this project explicitly will not attempt
- Prevents scope creep

---

## Constraints & Assumptions

- Technical constraints
- Platform constraints
- Assumptions that may later be revisited

---

## Stability Rules

- PROJECT_BRIEF.md should change infrequently
- If goals change materially, update this document first
- Detailed requirements belong in PRD.md or FEATURES.md
