# RUNBOOKS_GUIDE.md

## Purpose

Runbooks provide a structured, low-friction way to execute the agentic workflow
for a specific feature.

They exist to reduce cognitive load and manual decision-making during execution.

---

## What Runbooks Are

- A sequence of copy/paste-ready agent prompts
- Generated by the Planner
- Feature-specific
- Disposable and regenerable

---

## What Runbooks Are NOT

- A source of truth
- A replacement for FEATURES.md
- A replacement for STATUS.md
- A decision record
- A compliance artefact

---

## When to Create a Runbook

A runbook should be created when:
- A feature has a non-trivial agent path
- Conditional agents are involved
- The workflow has branching logic
- You want mechanical, error-free execution

---

## Who Creates Runbooks

- Planner creates or updates runbooks
- Other roles may request updates but must not modify them

---

## How Runbooks Are Used

1. Open the runbook for the feature
2. Execute prompts in order
3. Start a new agent for each step unless explicitly noted
4. Do not skip steps
5. If execution deviates, regenerate the runbook

---

## Relationship to FEATURES.md

- FEATURES.md defines what must be done
- Runbooks define how to execute it

If a conflict exists, FEATURES.md wins.

---

## Best Practices

- Keep prompts minimal
- Reference artefacts, do not inline them
- Use conditional steps sparingly
- Regenerate rather than patch runbooks

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Editing runbooks manually instead of regenerating
- Treating runbooks as authoritative
- Allowing roles to exceed their defined authority
- Skipping security review triggers

---

## Summary Rule

Runbooks reduce execution friction.
They must never introduce new truth.
