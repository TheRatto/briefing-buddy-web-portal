# BriefingBuddy Web Portal — Product Brief

## Product Name
**BriefingBuddy Web Portal** (working name)

## Problem Statement
Pilots are routinely presented with extremely large volumes of NOTAMs that are difficult to review, prioritise, and mentally model. Existing briefing tools prioritise completeness over comprehension, forcing pilots to manually trawl through dense, time-insensitive text to identify operationally relevant information.

This increases cognitive load, briefing time, and the risk of missing critical information.

## Product Vision
Provide pilots with a calm, structured, and time-aware NOTAM review experience that:
- Groups NOTAMs logically by **location/FIR → operational category**
- Highlights **when** a NOTAM matters at a glance
- Reduces trawling while preserving full access to raw data
- Enables an optional **AI-assisted operational briefing** without hiding source material

The web portal complements (but is separate from) the BriefingBuddy iOS app, enabling PDF-based workflows and desktop-first review.

## Target Users (MVP)
- Individual pilots
- IFR and VFR
- Desktop-first users

### Non-goals for MVP
- Multi-user organisations
- Dispatch or operations control workflows
- Offline usage

## Core Value Proposition
> “Help me quickly understand which NOTAMs matter to this flight, in this time window, without losing access to the rest.”
